Text file for understanding shit in developing an R package

DESCRIPTION file
  contains key metadata for the package that is used by repositorys like CRAN and R itself
  pakcage name, version number, author(s), maintainer contact info, license info, and any dependencies

NAMESPACE file
  export("function name")
  import(dependency1)
  import(dependencyN)
  importFrom("depedency","function names")
  better to use importFrom and to be speciic about what functions we would need to pull from those packages
  it is important to think through which functions you want to export
    each exported function must be documented and supported
    users would expect them to be there in subsequent iterations of the package
    best to limit the number of functions that are exported
      minimizing number of exports reduces the chances of a conflict with other packages

Difference between loading a package namespace and attaching it
  sometimes necessary to make another package visible to the user (attaching)

Sub-directory contains all of the R code, either single file or in multiple files
  for larger packages, usually best to split code into multiple files that logically group functions together
  name of these files don't matter, but do NOT include spaces in this name

roxygen2
  allows us to write documentation directly into the R code files
  little interaction with the man directory as all of the files in there will be auto generated by roxygen2
